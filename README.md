### Hi there 👋 I am Simha Kalimipalli!

I've recently completed by B.A.Sc from the University of Waterloo in Systems Design Engineering. 

I'm current a Master's student at the University of Toronto researching image generation techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks to predict radiotherapy dosage for Patient Specific Quality Assurance. 

I'm interested in Multi-Domain Machine Learning research using techniques such as text classification, object detection, LLM/RAG systems, and time series analysis. 

My research interest areas include applications to transportation, energy and healthcare infrastructure. 

Check out some of the things I've made below:
